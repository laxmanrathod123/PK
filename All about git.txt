If we faced this recent below error : 
On branch main
Your branch is based on 'origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

Then use this below command to resolve this error 

git@upstream-error  /c/branch/push (new-branch)
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
cd git*
git switch -c new-branch
git branch -a
touch devo.html
git add .
git commit -m "Are we not men?"
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
touch echo.html
git add .
git commit -m "Echo done"
git push origin
